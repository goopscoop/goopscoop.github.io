It is a site developed for developers to share and discover the best web development tools, libraries, frameworks and more, effectively removing the need for cluttered bookmarks folders while making the task of discovering and vetting obscure libraries much simpler.Developed by a team of two, it was built with Ruby on Rails, Angular, Material, Materialize, PostgreSQL, which is a setup I simply love. It features tool reviews formatted with Markdown, upvotes, great search capabilities, and a personal tool box for users to save and easily find their favorite tools as well as links to their documentation, repositories and official websites. And that's just the beginning!Memory LaneMemoryLn.me was a group project developed by myself, and two team mates. I worked as project manager while building the Ruby on Rails powered backend and designing a variety of features.

It's powered by Node.js, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and Bootstrap.EducationGeneral Assembly - Web Development Immersive 2015University of Washington - Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.)
