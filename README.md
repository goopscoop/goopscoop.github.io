## About me

Hi, I'm Cody Barrus. I'm a web developer and science fiction author with a background in internet marketing. I'm passionate about creating things, problem solving, and telling stories. Whether it's developing the plot of a thrilling steampunk adventure novel, or developing a great app that takes the thought out of lunch, I enjoy every aspect of the creation process.

As a developer, I enjoy developing in front end, back end or full stack capacities. I especially enjoy working with Angular.js and Ruby on Rails, and have experience with a variety of frameworks, libraries, and tools including Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, jQuery, Bootstrap, Materialize.css, Material and more.

## Job Seeker
