Issaquah, WA
I'm a web developer and science fiction author. Really, I'm just passionate about creating things, problem solving, and telling stories. Whether it's developing the plot of a kick ass adventure novel, or developing great web based apps, I'm enthusiastic about every aspect of the creation process. 
As a developer, I enjoy developing front end, back end or full stack. On the front end, I have experience with Angular.js and love working with it. I've also worked extensively with Bootstrap, and design fully responsive sites. On the back end, I've worked in Node.js and Ruby on Rails and enjoy developing solid backend on both.

Projects 
LunchBreak.Ninja 
LunchBreak.ninja is a project I build in a week while in the General Assembly Web Development Immersive program. The app finds a random, highly rated restaurant within walking distance, effectively removing the conversation "Where do you want to eat?" "I don't know, where do you want to eat?" Developed from the ground up on Node.js using a Postgres database on the back end, powered by the Yelp API, with JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML and Bootstrap on the front end. 
Memory Lane 
MemoryLn.me was a group project developed by myself, Jake Rohr and Aida Mengistu. I worked as project manager while working primarily on the backend, setting up databases and working with Ruby on Rails. My contribution also included many of the features, including the ability to add blocks and choose themes in edit mode. 
As product manager, we I set up a agile work flow. Due to the week long production, we kicked agile into overdrive, meeting twice a day to discuss tactics, evaluate which features to add next.
